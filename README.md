### MZmine_GroupMapping.ipynb

Jupyter notebook used to map metadata onto the mass spectral molecular network in Cytoscape version 3.4.0 ([Shannon et al., 2003](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/11/2498.full)) for the MZmine 2 ([Pluskal et al., 2010](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-395)) preprocessed dataset.

# Folders

## ClassyFire

The folder called **ClassyFire** contains R scripts and data files used for performing automated chemical classification of the <i>in silico</i> annotated structures using ClassyFire ([Djoumbou Feunang et al., 2016](https://jcheminf.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0174-y)).

## Mass2Motifs_2_MolecularNetwork

The folder called **Mass2Motifs_2_MolecularNetwork** contains R scripts and data files used for mapping Mass2Motifs ([Van der Hooft et al., 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/48/13738.full); [Wandy et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/2/317/4158166)) on the mass spectral molecular networks ([Wang et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3597); [Watrous et al., 2012](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/26/E1743)). 

## Heatmap_Subclasses

The folder called **Heatmap_subclasses** contains Jupyter notebook and data files for chemical subclass distribution heatmap (Figure 3(c)).

## Heatmap_Mass2Motifs

The folder called **Heatmap_Mass2Motifs** contains Jupyter notebook and data files for Mass2Motifs distribution heatmap (Figure 4).

## ChemicalClass_DistanceMetric

The folder called **ChemicalClass_DistanceMetric** contains python and R scripts as well as data files used for calculating a  chemically informed distance metric based on ClassyFire chemical ontology inspired by the metric proposed by [Junker, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00049-017-0250-4).

## CSCD

The folder called **CSCD** contains jupyter notebooks and data files used for calculating the chemical structural and compositional dissimilarity (CSCD) proposed by [Sedio et al., 2017](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1689).
